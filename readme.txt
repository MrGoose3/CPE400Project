// Description

We convert a network traffic capture (pcap) file into a visual presentation on Google Maps. 
we then use Wireshark to capture network traffic, Python for data processing, and Google Maps for visualization.

// Getting Started

Instructions for setting up your project on a user's local machine.

// Prerequisites

1. **GeoLiteCity**: Download the GeoLiteCity database to translate IP addresses into geographic coordinates. [GeoLiteCity Database](https://github.com/mbcc2006/GeoLiteCity-data)

2. **Wireshark**: Install Wireshark to capture network traffic. [Wireshark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/)

3. **Python 3**: If Python is not already installed on your device, download Python 3.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).


// Features

Diplay the google maps location of an IP address


// Libs
pip install dpkt
pip install pygeoip
